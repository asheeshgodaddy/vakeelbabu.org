          <h2>What is an FIR and Why Is It Important?</h2>
          <br>
          <p class="text-section">
            In the Indian legal system, <b>FIR</b> stands for <b>First Information Report</b>. It is the <b>initial step</b> taken by the police to initiate a criminal investigation when a <b>cognizable offence</b> is reported. This could include serious crimes such as <b>theft, assault, rape, domestic violence, or murder</b>.
            <br>
            <br>
            An FIR is a crucial document because it sets the criminal law machinery in motion. Once an FIR is registered, the police are legally bound to investigate the matter and take appropriate action.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Who Can File an FIR in India?</h2><br>

          <br>
          <h2>Types of Offences and FIR Relevance</h2><br>
          <p class="text-section">
            There are <b>two main types of offences</b> in India:
          </p>
          <br>
          <ul class="justified-list">
            <li><b>Cognizable Offences</b> - Serious crimes where police can act without prior court approval (e.g. murder, rape, kidnapping).</li>
            <li><b>Non-Cognizable Offences</b> - Less serious offences (e.g. defamation, public nuisance), where police need court approval to proceed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-section">
            <b><i>FIRs are typically filed for cognizable offences.</i></b>
            <br><br>
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>How to File an FIR – Step-by-Step</h2><br>
          <ul class="justified-list">
            <li>Visit the nearest police station (within jurisdiction of the incident).</li>
            <li>Give all details of the crime: what happened, when, where, and who was involved (if known).</li>
            <li>FIR will be written down by the police and read back to you.</li>
            <li>Verify the content and sign it.</li>
            <li>Ask for a free copy of the FIR – it’s your legal right.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p class="test-section">
            <b>TIP:</b> In many Indian states, you can also file an FIR online through the state police portal.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Your Rights When Filing an FIR</h2><br>
          <ul class="justified-list">
            <li>Right to be heard and file FIR without delay</li>
            <li>Right to receive a free copy of the FIR</li>
            <li>Right to file FIR in your language</li>

          </ul>
          <br>
          <h2>What is a Zero FIR?</h2><br>
          <p class="test-section">
            A <b>Zero FIR</b> can be filed <b>at any police station</b>, regardless of the location of the crime. It is transferred to the appropriate jurisdiction later, but ensures no delay in action - especially helpful in <b>emergency cases like sexual assault or missing persons</b>.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>What If the Police Refuse to File an FIR?</h2><br>
          <ul class="justified-list">
            <li><b>Approach the Superintendent of Police (SP) or DIG</b></li>
            <li><b>Send a written complaint via post or email</b></li>
            <li>File a complaint with a <b>Judicial Magistrate</b> under Section 156(3) CrPC</li>

          <h2>Filing False FIRs – A Legal Warning</h2><br>
          <p class="test-section">
            Filing a <b>false FIR</b> is a criminal offence under <b>Section 182 and 211 of IPC</b>. It can lead to <b>imprisonment and penalties</b>. Always ensure your report is based on facts and not vengeance or misinformation..
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2><br>
          <p class="test-section">
            <b>1. Can I file an FIR online?</b><br>
            Yes, many Indian states offer online FIR services. Check your <b>state police official website</b>.
