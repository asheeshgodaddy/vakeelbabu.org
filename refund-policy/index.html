          <li>If you change your mind after paying for a service, we won’t offer a refund, as there’s no issue with the service itself. </li>
          <li>If you request a refund more than 15 days after purchasing, and we’ve already completed the service (as confirmed by email or other communication), the refund request will not be accepted. </li>
